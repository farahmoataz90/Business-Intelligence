# Restaurant Reviews Prediction Model

This project aims to build a prediction model to classify customer reviews of a restaurant as either positive (liked) or negative (disliked). The dataset contains 2221 rows and 2 columns: Review and Liked.

## Steps:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Apply the most appropriate preprocessing steps, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, etc., to clean and prepare the data for modeling.

### 2. Feature Extraction

Apply feature extraction techniques such as Bag of Words or word embedding to convert the text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning models.

### 3. Model Selection

Select a classifier that is suitable for this data, considering its nature (text data) and the classification task (binary classification).

### 4. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the selected model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall to assess its performance in predicting whether a customer will like or dislike the restaurant based on their review.

## Tools and Libraries

This project will be implemented using Python and the following libraries:

- NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.
